# 100DaysOfDLCode

I stealt it from [@george-studenko](https://github.com/george-studenko) instructions for 100 Days of ML Code. Is the same but with __Deep Learning__, dude!

## Overview
These are the instructions for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval for the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge. 


## Motivation

We need as a society a way to learn. Learn from our history and stop applying the same errors from generation to generation. We need to learn to keep us working on relations, touching the other, with the most kindly possible way. But some times the others make it a very difficult task. That's the way I see all this new "tech-boom" named Deep Learning: as a glue between some part of us, to some other part of us. A thing that will connect us with our deepest interior.

## Eligibility 

- Everyone is eligible, even people who've never coded before

## The 3 Rules

- Make a public pledge to code or study deep learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform using the [__#100DaysofDLCode__] Hashtag. 
- Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example [template](https://gist.github.com/llSourcell/43194e486a92532bc343f7837b178eda). Another one is [here](https://github.com/LordSomen/100DaysOfML/blob/master/Log.md). You can also
make a blog or vlog. 
- If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofDLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment!

## Project Ideas

What we need is a project. Like conquer Uranus, or discover a new protonic laser sable, or a palant√≠r or even a mimir.

- There are many other projects out there though. Pick an industry that excites you, find a problem they have, locate a relevant dataset, apply AI to that dataset, and monetize the solution. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a good starting point


## Learning Resources

- [Siraj Raval on Youtube](https://youtube.com/c/sirajraval)
- [Tensorflow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)
- [A bunch of online courses](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning/blob/master/courses.md)
- [A bunch of public dataset](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets/blob/master/README.rst)

## Awards

- Siraj Raval will give a shoutout to some of the Wizards who succesfully complete the challenge, notify him if you've completed
it via Twitter [@sirajraval](https://twitter.com/sirajraval)
- By the end of 100 days, you'll be expected to have a project you've contributed to, whether your own or another. The more impact
you've had, the more likely you'll get a shoutout. Impact comes in the form of good documentation of your journey so that others can follow,
a project that improves the lives of other people, or real progress in your own ability to code deep learning.
