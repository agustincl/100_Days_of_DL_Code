# 100DaysOfDLCode

100 Days of Machine Learning Code. Full instructions about the challenge [here](https://github.com/agustincl/100_Days_of_DL_Code/blob/master/100_Days_of_DL_Code_Instructions.md)

__Grotowski, Jerzy. Towards a Poor Theatre Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 2012. p. 209.__ 

And I ask myself, which will be these obstacles?


##Â Ground Zero Project
We pretend to create an __Autonomous Swarm Indoor Drone Ecosystem__ (ASIDE).

And "by doing" achieve some results.

 - Learn Deep Learning
 - Learn about drones 
 - Code, code, code
 - Get some beers
 
So let's fly the Swarm!

## Day 1: Apr 2 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading [Neural networks for sentiment analysis in AsterixDB](https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/2569391). Found this very interesting, with a simple explanation of types of NN, and how to implement a model using [AsterixDB](https://asterixdb.apache.org/)

**Project's Progress**: The ASIDE (__Autonomous Swarm Indoor Drone Ecosystem__) project born today. Agile board created in Pivotal: [ASIDE Board](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2323589)

**Thoughts:** Happy to post and start doing #100_Days_of_DL_Code.

## Day 0: Apr 1 2019

**Today's Progress**: I want to create my own CNN using python. Found [Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTr3n7uBIuE&t=5s) of @llSourcell (Siraj Raval). Great explanation. 

**Project's Progress**: The Notebooks repo is ready on @george-studenko [Drone-Madness](https://github.com/george-studenko/Drone-Madness).

**Thoughts:** How to organize the team? Maybe too early to start with sprints...

## Day -1: Mar 31 2019

**Today's Progress**: Preparation of repositories, cleaning the code machine, and starting some library. Reading the experiences of others in 100_Days_of_ML_Code, to organize my next 100_Days_of_DL_Code. 

**Project's Progress**: We need a better name.

**Thoughts:** The project way is clear, but the 100_Days_of_ML_Code way, without any "index", looks hard to follow.

## Day -2: Mar 30 2019

**Today's Progress**: In @AISaturdaysEs 4 of us join to work on a drones project: The Drone Madness. Still planning, defining tasks, and workflow.

**Thoughts:** By now zero lines of code. But the next 50 days (demo day to @AISaturdaysES) we will work hard and with the commitment to 100_Days_of_DL_Code by the way.
